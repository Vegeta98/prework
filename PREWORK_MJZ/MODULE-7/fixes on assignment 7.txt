-changed "Boo the Dog Fan Page!" was not surrounded by <h1></h1>

-removed all the h4 text between lines 28-30

-removed lines 57,58

-removed lines 67-77

-pasted button code that was under the list of boo's favorite things an move it under line 68

-lines 99-103 added <li></li> to each of boo's favorite things

Did my best to mirror the code and correctly spaced everything, I don't want to spend too much time on this so I will save all the progress I've made. When I test the code in the browser it doesn't seem to be updating, not sure.
