My greatest challenge will be step 7 find a squad. I have always enjoyed working alone and not doing any school or job work with another person. It's not that I dislike people, I just find it easier when I am alone with my own thoughts. I can see the benefits of working with someone else who can give you a different perspective. I will try to push through my own limitations and work with others to achiev a shared goal.
